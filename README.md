## Installation from source

### System Requirements

* Ruby 2.1 or greater
* RubyGems and Bundler
* A MySQL database server

### Instructions

Before start, you'll need to create a new MySQL database:

```text
mysql$ CREATE DATABASE `staytus` CHARSET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
mysql$ GRANT ALL ON staytus.* TO `staytus`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY "a_secure_password";
```

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/adamcooke/staytus
$ cd staytus
$ git checkout stable
$ bundle install --deployment --without development:test
$ cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
$ nano -w config/database.yml # Add your database configuration
$ bundle exec rake staytus:build staytus:install
$ bundle exec foreman start
```

This will run the application on HTTP port 5000. When you first
login, you'll be able to add your own site settings. Browse to http://[IP]:5000
to begin.

You may also want to change the SMTP configuration via environment variables,
which are described in [`config/environment.example.yml`](config/environment.example.yml).

### Upgrading

Once you've installed Staytus, you can easily upgrade it by
following this process.

```text
$ cd path/to/staytus
$ git pull origin stable
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rake staytus:build staytus:upgrade
```

Once you've done this, you should ensure you restart any Staytus
processes which you have running.

## Setup with Docker

1. [Install Docker locally](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)
2. Run `docker run -d -p 0.0.0.0:80:5000 --name=staytus adamcooke/staytus`
3. Go to [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) and follow the instructions to configure Staytus

This will pull and start the latest published Staytus Docker image, and start it listening on port 80 on the host machine.

Note that this container includes two persistent volumes, one for the database (persisting all config and state) and one for persistent DB config.

### Upgrading with Docker

When a new Staytus Docker image is published that you'd like to upgrade to:

1. Stop your current Staytus container with `docker stop staytus`
2. Rename your previous container with `docker rename staytus staytus-old`
3. Start a new container, reusing your previous volumes, with `docker run -d -p 0.0.0.0:80:5000 --name=staytus --volumes-from=staytus-old adamcooke/staytus`
4. Delete the old container with `docker rm staytus-old`

This will automatically migrate your DB to pick up any new changes, and bring in any new code changes from the Staytus code.

## Administration

To log in for the first time, visit the `/admin`, and log in with email
`admin@example.com` and password `password`. You will probably want to go to
Settings -> Users and set up your admins.

## Themes

All themes are stored in the `content/themes` directory. You can
add your own themes in this directory but we do not recommend
making changes to the `default` theme as these changes may get
overridden in an upgrade.

Full details about how to make these will be coming soon.

##Â Examples in the wild

* [Viaduct Status Site](http://status.viaduct.io)
* [Dial 9 Status Site](http://status.dial9.co.uk)

If you're running Staytus in the wild, let us know so we can
add you to the list.
