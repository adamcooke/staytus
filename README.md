## Installation from source

### System Requirements

* Ruby 2.3 or greater
* RubyGems and Bundler
* A MySQL database server
* Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
* Procodile (`gem install procodile`)

### Installation Instructions

**A comprehensive tutorial about how to install Staytus [available here](https://atech.blog/atech/install-staytus-tutorial) on the [aTech Media blog](https://atech.blog).**

Alternativly, these basic instructions will get you up and running:

Before start, you'll need to create a new MySQL database:

```text
mysql$ CREATE DATABASE `staytus` CHARSET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
mysql$ GRANT ALL ON staytus.* TO `staytus`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY "a_secure_password";
```

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/adamcooke/staytus
$ cd staytus
$ git checkout stable
$ bundle install --deployment --without development:test
$ cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
$ nano -w config/database.yml # Add your database configuration
$ bundle exec rake staytus:build staytus:install
$ procodile start --foreground
```

This will run the application on HTTP port 5000. When you first
login, you'll be able to add your own site settings. Browse to http://[IP]:8787
to begin.

You may also want to change the SMTP configuration via environment variables,
which are described in [`config/environment.example.yml`](config/environment.example.yml).

To run staytus in the background, simply run `procodile start` without the `--foreground` option.

### Upgrading

Once you've installed Staytus, you can easily upgrade it by
following this process.

```text
$ cd path/to/staytus
$ git pull origin stable
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rake staytus:build staytus:upgrade
```

Once you've done this, you should ensure you restart any Staytus
processes which you have running.

## E-Mail Notifications

All e-mail notifications are sent through a background worker process. This will be started automatically when you run the application using `foreman start`. If you don't do this, you can run jobs using `bundle exec rake jobs:work`.

## Administration

To log in for the first time, visit the `/admin`, and log in with email
`admin@example.com` and password `password`. You will probably want to go to
Settings -> Users and set up your admins.

## Themes

All themes are stored in the `content/themes` directory. You can
add your own themes in this directory but we do not recommend
making changes to the `default` theme as these changes may get
overridden in an upgrade.

Full details about how to make these will be coming soon.
