# Staytus Roadmap

This page lists the proposed new functionality which I
hope to add to the Staytus application.

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to
[open up an issue](https://github.com/adamcooke/staytus/issues/new?labels=suggestion)
and tag it with suggestion.

* JSON API to allow services to be updated by external
  tools. For example, Nagios or Zabbix could updates
  statuses as appropriate when they detect issues.

* Built-in basic Ping, HTTP & DNS monitoring. Monitor
  given endpoints and automatically update statuses
  and/or create issues for any downtime which is noticed.

* Notifications. Allow users to subscribe to the status
  site and receive updates whenever new issues are posted
  or maintenance is scheduled.

* Integration with Twitter. Automatically update Twitter
  when issues occur, maintenance starts or statuses change.

These items will be converted into **epic** issues when
work begins and/or they become more than just a figment of
my imagination.
